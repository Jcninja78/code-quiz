# code-quiz

The purpose of this file is to give a short quiz to the user.

I am continuing to struggle to grasp the concept of Javascript. I attempted to reach out to a tutor this week but their schedule and mine did not match. I have a tutoring session scheduled for this Monday and I will go over with him my current shortcomings.

Working with Maria and Dan has helped me out a lot though and I hope we continue to do group projects as that seems to be the best way for me to learn.

I will also attempt to see if any of the other students would be available to start a study group as that would help me out as well; especially with the homework.
